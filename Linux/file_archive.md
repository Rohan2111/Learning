# What is File Archive?
- A file archive in Linux is a single file that contains a collection of files, directories, and their metadata (like permissions, timestamps, etc.) packaged together. Itâ€™s often used for backup, sharing, or storage purposes. Archives themselves do not compress files, but they are commonly used together with compression tools to create compressed archives.

# What is File Compression?
- File compression reduces the size of files by encoding their data more efficiently. This is especially useful for Backups, Storage, and File Transfer.

<br>

## Common File Compression Tools
### `Gzip`
---
- `gzip` compresses only files and replaces the original file with a compressed version, usually with a `.gz` extension
- **Compressing a file:**
```
gzip filename.txt
```
<br>

- **Decompressing a file:**
```
guzip filename.txt.gz
```
<br>

- **This command displays the contents of file.gz to the terminal without extracting it**
```
zcat file.gz
```
<br>

### `Tar` (Tape Archive):
---
- The `tar` command gathers files and directories into a single archive file, with a `.tar` extension
- **Creating a tar archive**
```
tar -cvf archive_name.tar file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
<br>

- **Compressing the tar archive with gzip**
```
tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
<br>

- **Decompressing a tar.gz archive**
```
tar -xzvf archive_name.tar.gz
```
<br>

- **Decompressing a tar.bz2 archive**
```
tar -xjvf archive_name.tar.bz2
```
<br>

- **The command lists the detailed contents of a compressed tar archive without extracting it, showing file names, permissions, sizes, and timestamps**
```
tar -tzvf archive_name.tar.gz
```
<br>

### `Zip` and `Unzip`
---
- The `zip` command is also commonly used for creating compressed archives in a format compatible with Windows also
- **Compressing Multiple files**
```
zip archive_name.zip file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
<br>

- **Decompressing a zip archive**
```
unzip archive_name.zip
```
<br>

- **This command provides detailed information about the contents of a ZIP archive, including file names, sizes, and permissions.**
```
zipinfo file.zip
```
